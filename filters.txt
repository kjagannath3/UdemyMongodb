filters are of type document, and we can use them to narrow down our crud operations to specific Documents

example: db.flightData.deleteOne({_id: "yo wassup"}): deletes the document in the flightData collection with id "yo wassup"

for deleteMany, we need to have similar fields

To filter greater than, less than, use the keyword $gt, $lt

e.g: b.flightData.deleteOne({distance: {$gt: 1000}}), deletes all flight documents with distance greater than 1000

projection: find({}, {<field>: 1}): show only specific fields
